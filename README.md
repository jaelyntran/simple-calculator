# simple-calculator

A basic calculator application that performs fundamental arithmetic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—while also offers the ability to recall the last five calculation results within a user-friendly interface.


Goals
- Develop a functional and visually appealing calculator application that operates smoothly across major desktop operating systems.
- Implement a result history feature to enhance user experience by allowing access to recent calculations.
- Gain experience in cross-platform development and familiarize yourself with tools and frameworks for building desktop applications.


Challenges
- Difficulty in choosing the optimal approach, such as whether to handle a single mathematical expression input or to support complex, multi-step calculations in one input.
- Difficulty in determining the correct interpretation of the percentage sign, such as whether to subtract a certain percentage of the total sum or to subtract a fixed amount equivalent to the percentage value from the sum.
